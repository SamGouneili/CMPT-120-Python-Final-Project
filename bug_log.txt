Bug changelog

Location:

AMAZINGEXPLODEXD
-Bug: ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'letter;
	-if an amazing explosion happened outside the map, function would return a string instead of the list, 
	fixed (line 77)



roll_dice

-Bug: returning nothing
	
	-had to return(circularmovement(x, x, x)), which returns its own value



presentlist

	-Fixed grid presentation


	-(v2_2) Moved .split to txttolist(), so the list gets rid of the hyphens at the beginning
		-Only have to split the list once, prevents crash of presentlist after second loop (since
		hyphens will no longer be present, and therefore will have nothing to split)
		-Believe this also fixed coolaliens, more testing needed	

Top level
-Bug: entering a value for movement crashed the game
	-Used a comma in the input statement (line 327), read that as 2 arguments
	-Added roll_dice function, dice rolls were integrated into the movement function


-Bug: saying no to Python Planet crashes
	
	-Moved all input statements to above the py_planet_cond if statement
	
	-Changed elif condition
 ("n")

==== CORRECTED XD -- MEL 
-Main problem: variable mixups with mel + cam

-times played = timesplayed+1
-wins are accumed
-total rocks are accumed
-if pyplanet reached, player collects 999 rocks and 999 fuel
	-noted in final results that he has

-NOOB FIX: at end of nested while loop iteration moves += 1
	**it used to run till death
-at end of NOT NESTED while loop, if user sets play to n, no_play = False
	-so it prints FINAL END GAME RESULTS

-HUGE UPDATE: realized how Cam did list. much more convenient bless you..
